## Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a budding creative engineer and artist. 
Passionate about sustainability, community-driven projects, interactive coding, and a dose of random (think “choose your own adventure”, solo travel, art installations, and good food). Currently exploring ways to use technology for **positive change** and **empowerment**.
