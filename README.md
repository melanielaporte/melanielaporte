## About Me 
I’m a creative technologist and CS student at Columbia University. I design, prototype, and code tools, systems, and interactive experiences that blend technology, design, and storytelling. My work explores social, historical, and public-health challenges, turning ideas into prototypes, dashboards, and devices that people can actually use. 

I’m especially interested in hardware-software integration, systems and automation, and data-driven interactive tools.
