 ## About Me 

I’m a creative technologist and CS student at Columbia University. I build tools, systems, and interactive experiences that merge technology, design, and storytelling. My work explores social, historical, and public-health challenges, turning ideas into prototypes, dashboards, and devices that people can actually use. 

Creative Technologist | CS Student | Systems & Interactive Prototyping

I'm focused on:
